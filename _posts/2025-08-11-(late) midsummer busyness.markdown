This summer has been many things, but mostly, <b>hot, humid, and busy.</b>

In my post on <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>, I mentioned at the end I was working on a 3D print of Verso's sword, and since then, it has been completed!

<div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; float: left; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/2025-8-13/hrd5knfz.png" width="350" height="150">
        <div></div>
</div>

Originally I wasn't going to do any of the finishing on this, but after it had printed I mainly thought, <i>"This is really cool, and I want to do my best at it."</i>, so I did!. It had been a while since I went thru the whole ordeal of truly <i>finishing</i> a print, and much was (re)learned in the process, but mostly:
<ul>
    <li>Use waaay more filler putty</li>
    <li>The painters tent is <b>not</b> too much effort</li>
    <li>Cool it on the filler primer</li>
    <li>Watch the paint on bits that connect</li>
    <li>Curse the environment/season</li>
</ul>

As for that last bit- this whole process was slowed down significantly by the requisite 2 day curing period for primer or paint either always ending on a day where I had to be somewhere else after work, or either raining, being 80%+ humidity, or 95+ degrees! Having a good day where I was available was a rarer thing than I anticipated, that's for sure. All in all I'm glad I did it as I feel much more prepared to tackle future prints.

Speaking of those future prints, here are some! A preview of what's to come:

        <strong>this red <i>really</i> pops</strong><br>
</div>
<br/>

More on this cosplay later, but it has sent me down the path of EVA foam, which isn't as difficult as I thought it would be so far, but I've yet to do any painting, so we'll see how that turns out. I've had to learn some basic patterning, and am having to grapple with figuring out how to keep pieces connected together, but I'm excited to get the first major foam piece done just to see what I'm capable of and have a better idea of how to improve. At the start with all these firsts, every step in the process is fairly intimidating, but there are a <i>ton</i> of excellent resources I've been able to reference so I always know I'll likely find something to help me out if I do a few quick searches. Somehow, the process of working on cosplay somehow manages to be less of a frustrating process than 2D art, though perhaps it's a matter of expectation.

Among all of this has been a lot of local travelling, visits to cool restaurants, a lot of movies, some Ren Faire more <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> than I would've anticipated, an end to a big multi-year DnD campaign that through ups and downs ended quite well, and several trial Pathfinder 2E sessions, leading up to a new campaign starting soon! While many of these things have slowed the above work, I'd say those are some pretty good reasons for it! 

As for games, in the coming months I'm mainly looking towards <i>Silent Hill: f</i>, a potential <i><abbr title="not clowning I swear">Hollow Knight: Silksong</abbr></i>, and <i>Touhou Kinjoukyou ~ Fossilized Wonders.</i>- plus a few other things here and there. 


That's all for now- 'til next time!
