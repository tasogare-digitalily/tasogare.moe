If you have somehow found yourself here, welcome!
This is the inaugural post for this small web project. As of posting, much is still in flight, but I wanted something to replace the default jekyll post, so here you are.

The content here is largely going to be unfocused, I think, and there's a realistic chance this will be the only content ever posted. We'll see where it goes.
Managing a website isn't exactly a fun thing in and of itself, and I've already made more allowances for automation (in terms of deployment, mostly) than I would prefer, but after destroying nginx on my last webserver that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. At the end of the day, so long as one has the files (which I intend on storing on github- see button in the footer), hosting can be figured out. 

While I am ostensibly a professional software developer who works with these technologies, I'm not keen on getting uselessly fancy with react or other web frameworks, especially when it comes to database management and general maintenance. I've recently happened across more of this retro 90s early 00s style of angelfire/neocities website and decided I'd give it a shot for a couple of reasons:
1. Static websites are nice and easy, relatively
2. That era of the internet is supremely nostalgic, so it's fun in that sense
3. Non-hyper-moden web design is nice, once in a while, and you don't have to sacrifice usability totally for it.

I came across <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/">petrapixel's</a> site in my travels and found their generator tool, which I used as a basis for style. Structurally, since I'm ultimately decided to use jekyll, this has already been picked apart a bit and will be picked apart further as I determine the needs for this space, but it was a lovely foundation to begin with and credit due is credit due. Would suggest giving their site a look if you are also interested in starting a website!

This'll be all for now- as said this very well could be the last update this site ever sees, which may be true on a technicality- some stuff is likely coming sooner rather than later, but I want to get the site as a whole in a better organized spot first.

'til then- see ya!
